**cd:** This isn't an error, however it also doensn't do anything as there is no argument to change the directory (the directory stays the same)
Absolute path: /Users/j.t

<img width="716" alt="ls-noArgs" src="https://github.com/JakeTranUCSD/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/147591070/9af1287f-ef56-4b97-aeeb-012a78bdee65">

**ls:** This isn't an error, it produces a list of files in the current directory
Absolute path: /Users/j.t
