**cd:** This isn't an error, however it also doensn't do anything as there is no argument to change the directory (the directory stays the same)
Absolute path: /Users/j.t


<img width="716" alt="ls-noArgs" src="https://github.com/JakeTranUCSD/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/147591070/9af1287f-ef56-4b97-aeeb-012a78bdee65">

**ls:** This isn't an error, it produces a list of files in the current directory.
Absolute path: /Users/j.t


<img width="230" alt="cat-noArgs" src="https://github.com/JakeTranUCSD/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/147591070/7632c7ab-4f9f-492a-89c8-24dd38ba2b42">

**cat:** This produces an error as there is nothing to cat (cat needs a file as the argument). It won't produce anything and won't stop running.
Absolute path: /Users/j.t


## **Below are examples of using cd, ls, and cat with a directory as an argument:**

<img width="293" alt="cd-directory" src="https://github.com/JakeTranUCSD/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/147591070/e902aad5-68b3-413a-9557-ef5cdcfb8c5c">

**ls:** This isn't an error and it lists the text files in the messages directory. 
Absolute path: /Users/j.t/lecture1

<img width="355" alt="cat-directory" src="https://github.com/JakeTranUCSD/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/147591070/68a48816-a4ed-4794-b061-b0fc774adf42">

**cat:** This is an error since cat only accepts files as arguments. The error message is: "cat: messages: Is a directory".
Absolute path: /Users/j.t/lecture1


## **Below are examples of using cd, ls, and cat with a file as an argument:**

<img width="365" alt="cd-file" src="https://github.com/JakeTranUCSD/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/147591070/8f47caac-a8fb-475b-b2f2-38dbe1ebbd5e">

**ls:** This isn't an error. When ls is used with a file, it displays the file name. (Note: it can provide more information about the file but that would require further commands than just "ls Hello.java"
Absolute path: /Users/j.t/lecture1

<img width="525" alt="cat-file" src="https://github.com/JakeTranUCSD/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/147591070/ec5e3086-2743-42b4-a485-96d281ac03af">
