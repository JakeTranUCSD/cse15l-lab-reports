**cd:** This isn't an error, however it also doensn't do anything as there is no argument to change the directory (the directory stays the same)
Absolute path: /Users/j.t

**ls:** This isn't an error, it produces a list of files in the current directory.
Absolute path: /Users/j.t

Absolute path: /Users/j.t
