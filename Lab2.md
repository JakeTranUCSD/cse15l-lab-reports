The two methods in my program is called handleRequest and getAllMessages. With the path `/add-message?s=Hello%20World!&user=Jake` It adds the new message to the server. In this path, the s parameter (message) is "Hello World!" and the user parameter is "Jake". The method being called is handleRequest. The relevant argument is the URL (which changes depending on the message being added), which is this case is: `http://localhost:4000/add-message?s=Hello%20World!&user=Jake`
